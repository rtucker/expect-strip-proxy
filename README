I am expect-strip-proxy.  I strip the Expect: headers off of HTTP requests.
I do this because some common URL libraries include "Expect: 100-continue"
when they're sending "large" amounts of data in a POST.  This is all
well and good, but lighttpd (as included with Ubuntu 8.04, at least) implodes
when it gets this.  The RFC is a bit of a catch-22, you see: if you don't
know about the Expect: header, you'll ignore it and everything works fine.
If you DO know about it and don't support it, you have to supply the
dreaded 417 Expectation Failed: http://www.flickr.com/photos/apelad/304197810/

Speaking of which, Flickr's blog-posting API does this, which is why I
wrote this.

Requires twisted, Python, and the editing of the config stuff towards the top.

Read it before you run it.
